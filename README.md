# go_fibonacci

A golang program that I was requested to write as part of an interview process.

The fibonacci package contains two public functions to return or print a fibonacci sequence from f(0) to f(n).

main\main.go contains a main function to print the fibonacci sequence from f(0) to f(n) where n is either a single command-line argument or the number 20 if no argument is provided.

Run instructions:
> go build main\main.go
> ./main(.exe)
or
> go run main\main.go
